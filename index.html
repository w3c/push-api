        The <cite>Push API</cite> enables sending of a <a>push message</a> to a web application via
        a <a>push service</a>. An <a>application server</a> can send a <a>push message</a> at any
        time, even when a web application or <a>user agent</a> is inactive. The <a>push service</a>
        ensures reliable and efficient delivery to the <a>user agent</a>. <a>Push messages</a> are
        delivered to a <a>Service Worker</a> that runs in the origin of the web application, which
        can use the information in the message to update local state or display a notification to
        the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification is designed for use with the <a>web push protocol</a>, which describes
        how an <a>application server</a> or <a>user agent</a> interacts with a <a>push service</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Push API allows a web application to communicate with a <a>user agent</a>
        asynchronously. This allows an <a>application server</a> to provide the <a>user agent</a>
        with time-sensitive information whenever that information becomes known, rather than
        waiting for a user to open the web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        As defined here, <a>push services</a> support delivery of <a>push messages</a> at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, a <a>push message</a> will be delivered to the web application even if that
        web application is not currently active in a browser window: this relates to use cases in
        which the user may close the web application, but still benefits from the web application
        being able to be restarted when a <a>push message</a> is received. For example, a <a>push
        message</a> might be used to inform the user of an incoming WebRTC call.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>push message</a> can also be sent when the <a>user agent</a> is temporarily offline.
        In support of this, the <a>push service</a> stores messages for the <a>user agent</a> until
        the <a>user agent</a> becomes available. This supports use cases where a web application
        learns of changes that occur while a user is offline and ensures that the <a>user agent</a>
        can be provided with relevant information in a timely fashion. <a>Push messages</a> are
        stored by the <a>push service</a> until the <a>user agent</a> becomes reachable and the
        message can be delivered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Push API will also ensure reliable delivery of push messages while a <a>user agent</a>
        is actively using a web application, for instance if a user is actively using the web
        application or the web application is in active communication with an <a>application
        server</a> through an active worker, frame, or background window. This is not the primary
        use case for the Push API. A web application might choose to use the Push API for
        infrequent messages to avoid having to maintain constant communications with the
        <a>application server</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Push messaging is best suited to occasions where there is not already an active
        communications channel established between <a>user agent</a> and web application. Sending
        <a>push messages</a> requires considerably more resources when compared with more direct
        methods of communication such as [[[fetch]]] or <a data-cite=
        "html/web-sockets.html#network">websockets</a>. <a>Push messages</a> usually have higher
        latency than direct communications and they can also be subject to restrictions on use.
        Most <a>push services</a> limit the size and quantity of <a>push messages</a> that can be
        sent.

        The <dfn>web push protocol</dfn> [[RFC8030]] describes a protocol that enables
        communication between a <a>user agent</a> or <a>application server</a> and a <a>push
        service</a>. Alternative protocols could be used in place of this protocol, but this
        specification assumes the use of this protocol; alternative protocols are expected to
        provide compatible semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code><dfn>Content-Encoding</dfn></code> HTTP header, described in Section 3.1.2.2 of

          A <dfn>push message</dfn> is data sent to a web application from an <a>application
          server</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>push message</a> is delivered to the [=service worker registration/active worker=]
          associated with the <a>push subscription</a> to which the message was submitted. If the

        <h2>
          Push subscription
        </h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>push subscription</dfn> is a message delivery context established between the
          <a>user agent</a> and the <a>push service</a> on behalf of a web application. Each
          <a>push subscription</a> is associated with a <a>service worker registration</a> and a
          <a>service worker registration</a> has at most one <a>push subscription</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>push subscription</a> has an associated <dfn>push endpoint</dfn>. It MUST be the
          absolute URL exposed by the <a>push service</a> where the <a>application server</a> can
          send <a>push messages</a> to. A <a>push endpoint</a> MUST uniquely identify the <a>push
          subscription</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>push subscription</a> MAY have an associated <dfn>subscription expiration
          time</dfn>. When set, it MUST be the time, in milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1
          January 1970, at which the subscription will be <a>deactivated</a>. The <a>user agent</a>
          SHOULD attempt to <a>refresh</a> the push subscription before the subscription expires.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>push subscription</a> has internal slots for a P-256 <a>ECDH</a> key pair and an
          authentication secret in accordance with [[RFC8291]]. These slots MUST be populated when
          creating the <a>push subscription</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <a>user agent</a> has to change the keys for any reason, it MUST <a>fire the
          "`pushsubscriptionchange`" event</a> with the <a>service worker registration</a>
          associated with the <a>push subscription</a> as |registration|, a {{PushSubscription}}
          instance representing the <a>push subscription</a> having the old keys as
          |oldSubscription| and a {{PushSubscription}} instance representing the <a>push
          subscription</a> having the new keys as |newSubscription|.
        </p>
        <p>
          To <dfn>create a push subscription</dfn>, given an <a>PushSubscriptionOptions</a> object
          of |options|, the <a>user agent</a> must run the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let |subscription| be a new <a>push subscription</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Set the `options` attribute of |subscription| to be a copy of |options|.
          </li>
          <li>Generate a new P-256 <a>ECDH</a> key pair [[ANSI-X9-62]]. Store the private key in an
          internal slot on |subscription|; this value MUST NOT be made available to applications.
          The public key is also stored in an internal slot and can be retrieved by calling the
          {{PushSubscription/getKey()}} method of the {{PushSubscription}} with an argument of
          {{PushEncryptionKeyName/"p256dh"}}.
          </li>
          <li>Generate a new authentication secret, which is a sequence of octets as defined in
          [[RFC8291]]. Store the authentication secret in an internal slot on |subscription|. This
          key can be retrieved by calling the {{PushSubscription/getKey()}} method of the
          {{PushSubscription}} with an argument of {{PushEncryptionKeyName/"auth"}}.
          </li>
          <li>Make a request to the <a>push service</a> to create a new <a>push subscription</a>.
          Include the {{PushSubscriptionOptions/applicationServerKey}} attribute of |options| when
          it has been set.
          </li>
          <li>When the request has completed, return |subscription|.

          <p>
            A <a>user agent</a> or <a>push service</a> MAY choose to <dfn>refresh</dfn> a <a>push
            subscription</a> at any time, for example because it has reached a certain age.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this happens, the <a>user agent</a> MUST run the steps to <a>create a push
            subscription</a> given the <a>PushSubscriptionOptions</a> that were provided for
            creating the current <a>push subscription</a>. The new <a>push subscription</a> MUST
            have a key pair that's different from the original subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            When successful, <a>user agent</a> then MUST <a>fire the "`pushsubscriptionchange`"
            event</a> with the <a>service worker registration</a> associated with the <a>push
            subscription</a> as |registration|, a {{PushSubscription}} instance representing the
            initial <a>push subscription</a> as |oldSubscription| and a {{PushSubscription}}
            instance representing the new <a>push subscription</a> as |newSubscription|.
          </p>
          <p>
            To allow for time to propagate changes to <a>application servers</a>, a <a>user
            agent</a> MAY continue to accept messages for an old <a>push subscription</a> for a
            brief time after a refresh. Once messages have been received for a refreshed <a>push
            subscription</a>, any old <a>push subscriptions</a> MUST be <a>deactivated</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <a>user agent</a> is not able to refresh the <a>push subscription</a>, it SHOULD
            periodically retry the refresh. When the <a>push subscription</a> can no longer be
            used, for example because it has expired, the <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>fire the
            "`pushsubscriptionchange`" event</a> with the <a>service worker registration</a>
            associated with the <a>push subscription</a> as |registration|, a {{PushSubscription}}
            instance representing the deactivating <a>push subscription</a> as |oldSubscription|

          The term <dfn>push service</dfn> refers to a system that allows <a>application

        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The contents of a <a>push message</a> are encrypted [[RFC8291]]. However, the <a>push
        service</a> is still exposed to the metadata of messages sent by an <a>application
        server</a> to a <a>user agent</a> over a <a>push subscription</a>. This includes the
        timing, frequency and size of messages. Other than changing <a>push services</a>, which
        user agents may disallow, the only known mitigation is to increase the apparent message
        size by padding.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no guarantee that a <a>push message</a> was sent by an <a>application server</a>
        having the same origin as the web application. The <a>application server</a> is able to
        share the details necessary to use a <a>push subscription</a> with a third party at its own
        discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following requirements are intended to protect the privacy and security of the user as
        far as possible, and subject to meeting that goal, to protect the integrity of the
        <a>application server</a>'s communication with the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>User agents</a> MUST NOT provide Push API access to web applications without the
        <a>express permission</a> of the user. <a>User agents</a> MUST acquire consent for
        permission through a user interface for each call to the `subscribe()` method, unless a
        previous permission grant has been persisted, or a prearranged trust relationship applies.
        Permissions that are preserved beyond the current browsing session MUST be revocable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Push API may have to wake up the Service Worker associated with the <a>service worker
        registration</a> in order to run the developer-provided event handlers. This can cause
        resource usage, such as network traffic, that the <a>user agent</a> SHOULD attribute to the
        web application that created the <a>push subscription</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>user agent</a> MAY consider the <a>PushSubscriptionOptions</a> when acquiring
        permission or determining the permission status.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a permission is revoked, the <a>user agent</a> MAY <a>fire the
        "`pushsubscriptionchange`" event</a> for subscriptions created with that permission, with
        the <a>service worker registration</a> associated with the <a>push subscription</a> as
        |registration|, a {{PushSubscription}} instance representing the <a>push subscription</a>
        as |oldSubscription|, and `null` as |newSubscription|. The <a>user agent</a> MUST
        <a>deactivate</a> the affected subscriptions in parallel.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a <a>service worker registration</a> is unregistered, any associated <a>push
        subscription</a> MUST be <a>deactivated</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>push endpoint</a> MUST NOT expose information about the user to be derived by actors
        other than the <a>push service</a>, such as the user's device, identity or location. See
        the Privacy Considerations in [[RFC8030]] for the exact requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>push endpoint</a> of a <a>deactivated</a> <a>push subscription</a> MUST NOT be
        reused for a new <a>push subscription</a>. This prevents the creation of a persistent
        identifier that the user cannot remove. This also prevents reuse of the details of one
        <a>push subscription</a> to send <a>push messages</a> to another <a>push subscription</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>User agents</a> MUST implement the Push API to only be available in a [=secure
        context=]. This provides better protection for the user against man-in-the-middle attacks
        intended to obtain push subscription data. Browsers may ignore this rule for development
        purposes only.

        Push Framework
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <a>push message</a> is sent from an <a>application server</a> to a web application as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a>application server</a> requests that the <a>push service</a> deliver a <a>push
        message</a> using the [[RFC8030]]. This request uses the <a>push endpoint</a> included in
        the <a>push subscription</a>;
        </li>
        <li>the <a>push service</a> delivers the message to a specific <a>user agent</a>,
        identifying the <a>push endpoint</a> in the message;
        </li>
        <li>the <a>user agent</a> identifies the intended <a>Service Worker</a> and activates it as
        necessary, and delivers the <a>push message</a> to the <a>Service Worker</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This overall framework allows <a>application servers</a> to activate a <a>Service
        Worker</a> in response to events at the <a>application server</a>. Information about those
        events can be included in the <a>push message</a>, which allows the web application to
        react appropriately to those events, potentially without needing to initiate network
        requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following code and diagram illustrate a hypothetical use of the push API.

          The fields included in the {{PushSubscription}} is all the information needed for an
          <a>application server</a> to send a <a>push message</a>. Push services that are
          compatible with the Push API provide a <a>push endpoint</a> that conforms to the <a>web
          push protocol</a>. These parameters and attributes include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a>push endpoint</a> of a {{PushSubscription}} is a URL that allows an
          <a>application server</a> to request delivery of a <a>push message</a> to a web
          application.
          </li>
          <li>The {{PushSubscription/getKey()}} method on a {{PushSubscription}} is used to
          retrieve keying material used to encrypt and authenticate <a>push messages</a>. Each
          invocation of the function returns a new {{ArrayBuffer}} that contains the value of the
          corresponding key, or `null` if the identified key doesn't exist. Passing a value of
          {{PushEncryptionKeyName/"p256dh"}} retrieves a <dfn data-abbr="ECDH">elliptic curve
          Diffie-Hellman</dfn> public key associated with the <a>push subscription</a>. Passing a
          value of `auth` returns an authentication secret that an application server uses in
          authentication of its messages. These keys are used by the <a>application server</a> to
          encrypt and authenticate messages for the <a>push subscription</a>, as described in
          [[RFC8291]].

            NOT be used anymore. The value will be `null` when the <a>user agent</a> is not able to
            provide the full set of details, for example because of partial database corruption.

        Accessibility
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <cite>Push API</cite> does not provide any means itself to present data it receives
        from a [=push service=]. Instead, the <cite>Push API</cite> relies on other APIs â
        primarily the [[[NOTIFICATIONS]]] â to present received information to an end user. As
        such, there are no accessibility requirements for the <cite>Push API</cite> itself.
        However, specifications such as [[NOTIFICATIONS]] provide guidance how to present
        notifications in an accessible manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, presenting an accessible interface might depend on transferring more information
        than a push message can convey. Push messages are best suited to carrying small amounts of
        content or identifiers. Any larger resources need to be fetched from servers.

        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the
        <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it contains.
