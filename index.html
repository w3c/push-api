        The <cite>Push API</cite> enables sending of a <a>push message</a> to a <a>webapp</a> via a
        <a>push service</a>. An <a>application server</a> can send a <a>push message</a> at any
        time, even when a <a>webapp</a> or <a>user agent</a> is inactive. The <a>push service</a>
        ensures reliable and efficient delivery to the <a>user agent</a>. <a>Push messages</a> are
        delivered to a <a>Service Worker</a> that runs in the origin of the <a>webapp</a>, which
        can use the information in the message to update local state or display a notification to
        the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification is designed for use with the <a>web push protocol</a>, which describes
        how an <a>application server</a> or <a>user agent</a> interacts with a <a>push service</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Push API allows a <a>webapp</a> to communicate with a <a>user agent</a> asynchronously.
        This allows an <a>application server</a> to provide the <a>user agent</a> with
        time-sensitive information whenever that information becomes known, rather than waiting for
        a user to open the <a>webapp</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As defined here, <a>push services</a> support delivery of <a>push messages</a> at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, a <a>push message</a> will be delivered to the <a>webapp</a> even if that
        <a>webapp</a> is not currently active in a browser window: this relates to use cases in
        which the user may close the <a>webapp</a>, but still benefits from the <a>webapp</a> being
        able to be restarted when a <a>push message</a> is received. For example, a <a>push
        message</a> might be used to inform the user of an incoming WebRTC call.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>push message</a> can also be sent when the <a>user agent</a> is temporarily offline.
        In support of this, the <a>push service</a> stores messages for the <a>user agent</a> until
        the <a>user agent</a> becomes available. This supports use cases where a <a>webapp</a>
        learns of changes that occur while a user is offline and ensures that the <a>user agent</a>
        can be provided with relevant information in a timely fashion. <a>Push messages</a> are
        stored by the <a>push service</a> until the <a>user agent</a> becomes reachable and the
        message can be delivered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Push API will also ensure reliable delivery of push messages while a <a>user agent</a>
        is actively using a <a>webapp</a>, for instance if a user is actively using the
        <a>webapp</a> or the <a>webapp</a> is in active communication with an <a>application
        server</a> through an active worker, frame, or background window. This is not the primary
        use case for the Push API. A <a>webapp</a> might choose to use the Push API for infrequent
        messages to avoid having to maintain constant communications with the <a>application
        server</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Push messaging is best suited to occasions where there is not already an active
        communications channel established between <a>user agent</a> and <a>webapp</a>. Sending
        <a>push messages</a> requires considerably more resources when compared with more direct
        methods of communication such as [[[fetch]]] or <a data-cite=
        "html/web-sockets.html#network">websockets</a>. <a>Push messages</a> usually have higher
        latency than direct communications and they can also be subject to restrictions on use.
        Most <a>push services</a> limit the size and quantity of <a>push messages</a> that can be
        sent.

        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>push message</a> is delivered to the <a>active worker</a> associated with the

        <h2>
          Push subscription
        </h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>push subscription</dfn> is a message delivery context established between the
          <a>user agent</a> and the <a>push service</a> on behalf of a <a>webapp</a>. Each <a>push
          subscription</a> is associated with a <a>service worker registration</a> and a <a>service
          worker registration</a> has at most one <a>push subscription</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>push subscription</a> has an associated <dfn>push endpoint</dfn>. It MUST be the
          absolute URL exposed by the <a>push service</a> where the <a>application server</a> can
          send <a>push messages</a> to. A <a>push endpoint</a> MUST uniquely identify the <a>push
          subscription</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>push subscription</a> MAY have an associated <dfn>subscription expiration
          time</dfn>. When set, it MUST be the time, in milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1
          January 1970, at which the subscription will be <a>deactivated</a>. The <a>user agent</a>
          SHOULD attempt to <a>refresh</a> the push subscription before the subscription expires.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>push subscription</a> has internal slots for a P-256 <a>ECDH</a> key pair and an
          authentication secret in accordance with [[RFC8291]]. These slots MUST be populated when
          creating the <a>push subscription</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <a>user agent</a> has to change the keys for any reason, it MUST <a>fire the
          "`pushsubscriptionchange`" event</a> with the <a>service worker registration</a>
          associated with the <a>push subscription</a> as <var>registration</var>, a
          <a>PushSubscription</a> instance representing the <a>push subscription</a> having the old
          keys as <var>oldSubscription</var> and a <a>PushSubscription</a> instance representing
          the <a>push subscription</a> having the new keys as <var>newSubscription</var>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To <dfn>create a push subscription</dfn>, given an <a>PushSubscriptionOptions</a> object
          of <var>options</var>, the <a>user agent</a> must run the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>subscription</var> be a new <a>push subscription</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Set the `options` attribute of <var>subscription</var> to be a copy of
          <var>options</var>.
          </li>
          <li>Generate a new P-256 <a>ECDH</a> key pair [[ANSI-X9-62]]. Store the private key in an
          internal slot on <var>subscription</var>; this value MUST NOT be made available to
          applications. The public key is also stored in an internal slot and can be retrieved by
          calling the `getKey()` method of the <a>PushSubscription</a> with an argument of
          <a data-link-for="PushEncryptionKeyName">p256dh</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Generate a new authentication secret, which is a sequence of octets as defined in
          [[RFC8291]]. Store the authentication secret in an internal slot on
          <var>subscription</var>. This key can be retrieved by calling the `getKey()` method of
          the <a>PushSubscription</a> with an argument of <a data-link-for="PushEncryptionKeyName">
            auth</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Make a request to the <a>push service</a> to create a new <a>push subscription</a>.
          Include the <a data-link-for="PushSubscriptionOptions">applicationServerKey</a> attribute
          of <var>options</var> when it has been set.
          </li>
          <li>When the request has completed, return <var>subscription</var>.

          <p>
            A <a>user agent</a> or <a>push service</a> MAY choose to <dfn>refresh</dfn> a <a>push
            subscription</a> at any time, for example because it has reached a certain age.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this happens, the <a>user agent</a> MUST run the steps to <a>create a push
            subscription</a> given the <a>PushSubscriptionOptions</a> that were provided for
            creating the current <a>push subscription</a>. The new <a>push subscription</a> MUST
            have a key pair that's different from the original subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            When successful, <a>user agent</a> then MUST <a>fire the "`pushsubscriptionchange`"
            event</a> with the <a>service worker registration</a> associated with the <a>push
            subscription</a> as <var>registration</var>, a <a>PushSubscription</a> instance
            representing the initial <a>push subscription</a> as <var>oldSubscription</var> and a
            <a>PushSubscription</a> instance representing the new <a>push subscription</a> as
            <var>newSubscription</var>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To allow for time to propagate changes to <a>application servers</a>, a <a>user
            agent</a> MAY continue to accept messages for an old <a>push subscription</a> for a
            brief time after a refresh. Once messages have been received for a refreshed <a>push
            subscription</a>, any old <a>push subscriptions</a> MUST be <a>deactivated</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <a>user agent</a> is not able to refresh the <a>push subscription</a>, it SHOULD
            periodically retry the refresh. When the <a>push subscription</a> can no longer be
            used, for example because it has expired, the <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>fire the
            "`pushsubscriptionchange`" event</a> with the <a>service worker registration</a>
            associated with the <a>push subscription</a> as <var>registration</var>, a

          available. Reasons for doing so include performance-related concerns such as service
          availability (including whether services are blocked by firewalls in specific countries,
          or networks at workplaces and the like), reliability, impact on battery lifetime, and

        <p>
          The term <dfn>express permission</dfn> refers to an act by the user, e.g. via user

      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The contents of a <a>push message</a> are encrypted [[RFC8291]]. However, the <a>push
        service</a> is still exposed to the metadata of messages sent by an <a>application
        server</a> to a <a>user agent</a> over a <a>push subscription</a>. This includes the
        timing, frequency and size of messages. Other than changing <a>push services</a>, which
        user agents may disallow, the only known mitigation is to increase the apparent message
        size by padding.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no guarantee that a <a>push message</a> was sent by an <a>application server</a>
        having the same origin as the <a>webapp</a>. The <a>application server</a> is able to share
        the details necessary to use a <a>push subscription</a> with a third party at its own
        discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following requirements are intended to protect the privacy and security of the user as
        far as possible, and subject to meeting that goal, to protect the integrity of the
        <a>application server</a>'s communication with the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>User agents</a> MUST NOT provide Push API access to <a>webapps</a> without the
        <a>express permission</a> of the user. <a>User agents</a> MUST acquire consent for
        permission through a user interface for each call to the `subscribe()` method, unless a
        previous permission grant has been persisted, or a prearranged trust relationship applies.
        Permissions that are preserved beyond the current browsing session MUST be revocable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Push API may have to wake up the Service Worker associated with the <a>service worker
        registration</a> in order to run the developer-provided event handlers. This can cause
        resource usage, such as network traffic, that the <a>user agent</a> SHOULD attribute to the
        <a>webapp</a> that created the <a>push subscription</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>user agent</a> MAY consider the <a>PushSubscriptionOptions</a> when acquiring
        permission or determining the permission status.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a permission is revoked, the <a>user agent</a> MAY <a>fire the
        "`pushsubscriptionchange`" event</a> for subscriptions created with that permission, with
        the <a>service worker registration</a> associated with the <a>push subscription</a> as
        <var>registration</var>, a <a>PushSubscription</a> instance representing the <a>push
        subscription</a> as <var>oldSubscription</var>, and `null` as <var>newSubscription</var>.
        The <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>deactivate</a> the affected subscriptions in parallel.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a <a>service worker registration</a> is unregistered, any associated <a>push

        The <a>push endpoint</a> of a <a>deactivated</a> <a>push subscription</a> MUST NOT be
        reused for a new <a>push subscription</a>. This prevents the creation of a persistent

        A <a>push message</a> is sent from an <a>application server</a> to a <a>webapp</a> as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a>application server</a> requests that the <a>push service</a> deliver a <a>push
        message</a> using the [[RFC8030]]. This request uses the <a>push endpoint</a> included in
        the <a>push subscription</a>;
        </li>
        <li>the <a>push service</a> delivers the message to a specific <a>user agent</a>,
        identifying the <a>push endpoint</a> in the message;
        </li>
        <li>the <a>user agent</a> identifies the intended <a>Service Worker</a> and activates it as
        necessary, and delivers the <a>push message</a> to the <a>Service Worker</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This overall framework allows <a>application servers</a> to activate a <a>Service
        Worker</a> in response to events at the <a>application server</a>. Information about those
        events can be included in the <a>push message</a>, which allows the <a>webapp</a> to react
        appropriately to those events, potentially without needing to initiate network requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following code and diagram illustrate a hypothetical use of the push API.

        When getting the <dfn>endpoint</dfn> attribute, the <a>user agent</a> MUST return the

        MUST use a serialization method that does not contain input-dependent branchs (that is, one
        that is constant time).

      <p>
        When getting the <dfn>expirationTime</dfn> attribute, the <a>user agent</a> MUST return the

        is one, or `null` otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        When getting the <dfn>options</dfn> attribute, the <a>user agent</a> MUST return a

        The <dfn>getKey()</dfn> method retrieves keying material that can be used for encrypting

      <ol data-link-for="PushEncryptionKeyName">
        <li>Find the internal slot corresponding to the key named by the `name` argument.

        <li>If the internal slot contains an asymmetric key pair, set the contents of
        <var>key</var> to the serialized value of the public key from the key pair. This uses the
        serialization format described in the specification that defines the name. For example,
        [[RFC8291]] specifies that the <a>p256dh</a> public key is encoded using the uncompressed
        format defined in [[ANSI-X9-62]] Annex A (that is, a 65 octet sequence that starts with a
        0x04 octet).
        </li>
        <li>Otherwise, if the internal slot contains a symmetric key, set the contents of
        <var>key</var> to a copy of the value from the internal slot. For example, the `auth`
        parameter contains an octet sequence used by the <a>user agent</a> to authenticate messages
        sent by an <a>application server</a>.

                  receive a delivery receipt indicating successful delivery of the <a>push
                  message</a>. Therefore, multiple rejections SHOULD be permitted before
                  acknowledging; allowing at least three attempts is recommended.

        <p>
          The <a>pushsubscriptionchange</a> event indicates a change in a <a>push subscription</a>
          that was triggered outside of the application's control, for example because it has been
          refreshed, revoked or lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          To <dfn>fire the "`pushsubscriptionchange`" event</dfn> given a <a>service worker
          registration</a> of <var>registration</var>, <var>newSubscription</var> and
          <var>oldSubscription</var>, the <a>user agent</a> must <a>handle functional event</a>
          "`pushsubscriptionchange`" using <a>PushSubscriptionChangeEvent</a> on
          <var>registration</var> with the following properties:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            `newSubscription`
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <var>newSubscription</var>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            `oldSubscription`
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <var>oldSubscription</var>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="note">
          Consider using a more reliable synchronization mechanism such as [[WEB-BACKGROUND-SYNC]]
          when sending the details of the new <a>push subscription</a> to your <a>application
          server</a>. The user might be subject to unreliable network conditions that could cause a
          fetch to fail.
