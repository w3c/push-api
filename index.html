        The <cite>Push API</cite> provides <a title="webapp">webapps</a> with scripted access to
        server-sent messages, for simplicity referred to here as <a title="push message">push
        messages</a>, as delivered by <a title="push service">push services</a>. A <a>push

        message</a> will be delivered to a <a>Service Worker</a>, which could then store the
        message's data or display a notification to the user.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        As defined here, <a title="push service">push services</a> support delivery of <a>webapp
        server</a> messages in the following contexts and related use cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the user is actively involved in the use of a <a>webapp</a>: this relates to any normal
        use case in which a <a>webapp</a> user may benefit from <a title="push message">push
        messages</a> while the user is actively using the <a>webapp</a>
        </li>
        <li>the user is not actively involved in the use of a <a>webapp</a>, but the <a>webapp</a>
        is active in a window of the browser or executing as a web worker: this relates to use
        cases such as social networking, messaging, web feed readers, etc in which the user may not
        be actively using a <a>webapp</a> but still benefits from <a title="push message">push
        messages</a> being sent to (or via) the <a>webapp</a>, to keep the user up-to-date
        </li>
        <li>the <a>webapp</a> is not currently active in a browser window: this relates to use
        cases in which the user may close the <a>webapp</a>, but still benefits from the
        <a>webapp</a> being able to be restarted when a <a>push message</a> is received, e.g. the
        WebRTC use case in which an incoming call can invoke the WebRTC <a>webapp</a>
        </li>
        <li>multiple <a title="webapp">webapps</a> are running, but <a title="push message">push
        messages</a> are delivered only to the <a>webapp</a> that requested them, e.g. any normal
        use case in which multiple <a title="webapp">webapps</a> are active in the browser and
        utilizing <a title="push service">push services</a>
        </li>
        <li>multiple instances of the same <a>webapp</a> are active in the browser, and <a title=
        "push message">push messages</a> specific to each instance of the <a>webapp</a> are
        delivered only to the specific instance, e.g. when a mail <a>webapp</a> is active in two
        windows using different mail accounts
        </li>
        <li>multiple instances of the same <a>webapp</a> are active in different browsers, and push
        messages are delivered to a set of instances of the <a>webapp</a>, e.g. when a mail
        <a>webapp</a> is active in two browsers using the same email account
        </li>
        <li>multiple instances of the same <a>webapp</a> are active in different browsers, and push
        messages are delivered to all instances of the <a>webapp</a>, e.g. when a message is to be
        broadcasted to all users of the <a>webapp</a>
        </li>

      </h2>
      <p>
        Although <a title="push service">push services</a> are expected to differ in deployment, a
        typical deployment is expected to have the following general entities and example operation
        for delivery of <a title="push message">push messages</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a title="webapp server">Webapp servers</a> request delivery of a <a>push message</a> to
          a <a>webapp</a> via a RESTful API exposed by a <a>push server</a>
        </li>
        <li>The <a>push server</a> delivers the message to a specific <a>user agent</a>
        </li>
        <li>The <a>user agent</a> delivers the <a>push message</a> to the specific <a>webapp</a>
        intended to receive it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This overall framework allows <a title="webapp server">webapp servers</a> to inform
        <a title="webapp">webapps</a> that new data is available at the <a title=
        "webapp server">webapp server</a>, or pass the new data directly to the <a>webapp</a> in
        the <a>push message</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The push API enables delivery of arbitrary application data to <a title=
        "webapp">webapps</a>, and makes no assumptions about the over-the-air/wire protocol used by
        <a title="push service">push services</a>. As such, the details of what types of data flow
        through a <a title="push service">push services</a> for a particular <a>webapp</a> are
        specific to the <a>push service</a> and <a>webapp</a>. As needed, clarification about what
        data flows over-the-air/wire should be sought from <a>push service</a> operators or
        <a>webapp</a> developers.

        <h3>
          Push Server Discovery and API Use
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification does not define either specific normative methods via which webapps
          can determine the applicable push system, or initiate push requests through that system
          via a push server API. While these limitations add complexity for webapp developers, they
          reflect the current reality of a diversity of push systems, for which convergence at
          least in push server APIs, is not expected to be a short-term possibility. While a
          converged push server API is a worthwhile goal and may be addressed in a different
          specification, the Push API defined here has been designed to enable the current variety
          of push systems to be used as appropriate for the webapp host device or software
          platform. This section provides examples of how a webapp can be designed to work with a
          variety of hypothetical push systems as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Push API provides several interface parameters and attributes that can enable a
          webapp to deliver and obtain the necessary push system specific data enabling use of that
          particular push system. These parameters and attributes include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>registrationId</code> of a <code>PushRegistration</code>, as an opaque
          string to the Push API, may be used by push systems to provide meaningful data to the <a>
            webapp server</a> through the webapp. For example, the <code>registrationId</code> may
            be used as a push server API request parameter or request body element for specific
            push systems.
          </li>
          <li>As a URI, the <code>endpoint</code> of a <code>PushRegistration</code> provides a
          flexible means for push systems to deliver webapp-specific registration and/or push
          server API parameters to the <a>webapp server</a>, through the webapp.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Push systems that are compatible with the Push API will be expected to clarify how these
          data are used in the push server APIs of the specific system, e.g. through their
          developer programs. Examples of considerations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The URI used by the <a>webapp server</a> to issue push server API requests, which may
          be based upon the <code>endpoint</code>, and for a particular push server API request
          require additional parameters e.g. the <code>registrationId</code>.
          </li>
          <li>The push server API request body, which may require that the <code>endpoint</code> or
          <code>registrationId</code> be present in some body element.
          </li>
          <li>The <code>pushRegistration</code> attributes may only be used by the <a>webapp
          server</a> to associate the webapp to a specific push service registration, with the
          details of the push server API relying upon other pre-configured data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Push API does not provide any <code>pushRegistration</code> attributes that
          normatively identify the particular push system that applies to the registration. Webapps
          that are designed to work with a single push system are assumed to know inherently how to
          use the push server API of that system. For such webapps, a key consideration is ensuring
          that if the webapp is used on a device or browser that does not support the necessary
          push system, that either the user is informed that the push-dependent webapp functions
          will not work, or the webapp must use alternate methods e.g. [[websockets]] or [[SSE]] to
          deliver the server-initiated data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to use of a push server API, <a title="webapp server">webapp servers</a> that are
          designed to work with multiple push systems may need to determine the applicable system
          by parsing the <code>endpoint</code> to detect the push system from the URI domain.

        <h3>
          Push Registration Persistence
        </h3>
        <p>
          To facilitate persistence of push registrations when a <a>webapp</a> is closed, it can
          use a <a>Service Worker</a> to register for and receive push events. In that case, even
          if the <a>webapp</a> parent window is closed, the <code>pushRegistration</code> object
          will still enable delivery of <a title="push message">push messages</a>, through the
          <a>Service Worker</a>. The <a title="push message">push messages</a>, can then be
          processed by the <a>Service Worker</a>, e.g. including one or more of the following
          actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>store the <a title="push message">push messages</a> for later access by the
          <a>webapp</a> when reinvoked by the user
          </li>
          <li>invoke/reconstruct the <a>webapp</a>, a process that is not described here (expected
          to be clarified in [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]])
          </li>
          <li>delivery of the <a title="push message">push messages</a> data to the to the
          <a>webapp</a> as necessary through other means, e.g. [[webmessaging]].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a <a>webapp</a> creates a <a>push registration</a> without using a <a>Service
          Worker</a>, the <code>pushRegistration</code> object will persist only as long as the
          <a>webapp</a> window is open.

        <h3>
          Push Registration Uniqueness
        </h3>
        <p>
          Each <a>push registration</a> is unique, i.e. a single instance specific to each
          <a>webapp</a> and call to the <code>register</code> interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a title="webapp">webapps</a> that create multiple <a title="push registration">push
          registrations</a> are responsible for mapping the individual registrations to specific
          app functions as necessary. For example, the <a>webapp</a> or <a>webapp server</a> can
          associate a specific <code>pushRegistration</code> to a particular function of the app
          through JavaScript.
